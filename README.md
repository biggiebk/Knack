# Welcome to the Knack

## What is it?
Knack is a tool that hopes to simplify the job of devopers and engineers when it comes to quickly testing and integrating with external calls, programs or processes.  The current focus of the tool is to support HTTPS based calls in particluar RESTful API's, however the hope is to expand it to other things like local commands, remote calls via SSH, or really whatever else we can dream up.

There are other tools out their like this that are pretty full featured, however they never really meet my wants and desires.  One of things that I hope makes this tool unique is that it will be developed to work purely based off of the CLI and editing files by hand or other processes to help facilitate integration with other tools in the development chain.

## Functionality
* Support for making local HTTP/HTTPS web calls
* JSON and YAML friendly
* Repeatable and recorded testing
* Regex based patterns to determine successfull calls
* Custom templates enabling you to export out code to whatever language you want to better faciliate development.  Like to call this bridging.

### Future
* XML friendly
* Local commands
* Remote commands via SSH
* Databases
* Plugins for customizations
* Conditional workflows
* UI to facilitate editing

## Dependencies
* pysondb
* Jinja2

## Installation
TBD
